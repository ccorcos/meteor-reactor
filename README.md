# Reactor - React for Meteor

This is an opinionated package for integrating React with Meteor. This package offers some Coffeescript syntax jazz and a transparent way of building React components for Meteor.

This package also wraps Iron Router to make it work with React.

## Getting Started

    meteor add ccorcos:reactor

## To Do

- animation!
- [Velocity animation mixin](https://gist.github.com/tkafka/0d94c6ec94297bb67091).
- Observable streams for UI event handling would be nice - make a side menu!
