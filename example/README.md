# To Do

get rid of coffee syntax jazz! it ruins the key stuff. Just use createFactory


For Coffeescipt:

React.renderBody = (component) -> 
  React.render(component, document.body)

React.createClassFactory = (args...) ->
  React.createFactory(React.createClass.apply(React, args))


Come up with a way of registering components with some global object



document whats going on with search: passing a reactive variable around! Is there a better way of doing this? Maybe just use the session. Mixin to link with session variables!




How to handle post from search and post from home differently?



remember scroll offet, scroll to top touching the status bar?


search users OR posts





infinite scrolling with subscriptions

settings logout
profile picture


Recover password / reset password

Use subscription manager in react components


search microservice?
Demo app done
